    "productPage_intro": "We offer a device to perform a first diagnosis to detect sleep apnea in you if you suspect you have this disorder. We believe that our device only needs four sensors to detect signs of sleep apnea.",
    "productPage_heart": "The heart sensor is used to follow the beating of the heart. With this, during your night, we can determine the phases of agitation, the calm phases of the startle phases. See even jumps in breathing (which would indicate sleep apnea).",
    "productPage_sound": "Loud snoring is one of the major symptoms of sleep apnea. In order to be able to better detect this symptom, we therefore add a sound sensor to our device. It allows us to measure snoring and its intensities and possibly the patient's breathing.",
    "productPage_humy": "One of the first ways to detect sleep apnea in a patient is to measure their sweat rate while they sleep. People with sleep apnea suffer from excessive sweating, it is a first sign of the disease. That's why it's important to monitor your body temperature with a temperature and humidity sensor.",
    "productPage_temp": "The temperature sensor allows us to follow the ambient conditions of the room during the night. And indeed, sleeping in conditions that are too hot or too cold influences the quality of sleep.",
    "productPage_ccl1": "From the data of these four sensors, by correlating them each, we can determine, if you potentially have sleep apnea.",
    "productPage_ccl2": "The sensor looks like a sports headband to put on your head. It is to be positioned during all your nights. Data is sent to the server every hour and when you turn off the device. In the morning, you can go to the website or the application and observe the results obtained overnight.",
    "productPage_ccl3": "After self-analysis of your night cycles, if you think you have sleep apnea, you can go see a specialized doctor and show him your sleep records.",
